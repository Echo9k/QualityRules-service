Breakdown for the standardization process:

### Step 1: Standardize Description

This table aligns user descriptions to standard descriptions. The primary goal is to identify standard descriptions that encapsulate the rule intent while translating the user descriptions.

| Standard Description                                        | Users Description                                            |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| FIELD MUST BE UNIQUE                                        | The ID must be unique                                        |
| FIELD CONTAIN A VALUE, NAS OR NULL NOT ALLOWED              | The ID must not be empty                                     |
| FIELD BE NOT NEGATIVE                                       | The ID must not be negative                                  |
| FIELD MUST HAVE A LENGTH EQUAL TO 7                         | The ID must have a length of 7 characters                    |
| FIELD MUST HAVE A GREATER THAN 7 AND SMALLER OR EQUAL TO 12 | The ID must be between 7 and 12 characters                   |
| FIELD VALUE MUST BE GREATER THAN ZERO                       | The field should have a length of 7 characters               |
| FIELD NOT CONTAIN SEQUENCES OF MORE THAN 3 NUMBERS          | No more than 3 consecutive numbers are allowed               |
| FIELD NOT CONTAIN MORE THAN 5 REPEATED CHARACTERS           | The value of the field should not have more than 5 repeated characters |

### Step 2: Identify Rule

This table maps historical relationships from user descriptions to standard descriptions and identifies rule IDs and dimensions. Some descriptions require parameterization for full specification.

| Users Description                                     | Rule ID | Dimension    | Standard Description                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Should contain a value, no nulls are allowed          | 1       | Completeness | FIELD CONTAIN A VALUE, NAS OR NULL NOT ALLOWED               |
| This value must not be empty                          | 1       | Completeness | FIELD CONTAIN A VALUE, NAS OR NULL NOT ALLOWED               |
| The value should be at least zero and no more than 99 | 4       | Validity     | FIELD VALUE MUST BE GREATER OR EQUAL THAN 0 AND LOWER THAN 100 |
| Value should be no more than 1000                     | 3       | Validity     | FIELD BE LOWER OR EQUAL TO 1000                              |
| Value must be positive                                | 3       | Validity     | FIELD BE GREATER THAN ZERO                                   |
| Must have a length of 7 characters                    | 5       | Validity     | FIELD MUST HAVE A LENGTH EQUAL TO 7                          |
| No more than 3 consecutive numbers allowed            | 6       | Validity     | FIELD NOT CONTAIN SEQUENCES OF MORE THAN 3 NUMBERS           |
| No more than 5 repeated characters                    | 7       | Validity     | FIELD NOT CONTAIN MORE THAN 5 REPEATED CHARACTERS            |

### Step 3: Fill in Parameters

This step clarifies any necessary parameters for each rule based on the user descriptions:

- **Rule 1**: No parameters needed (checks field for non-empty).
- **Rule 3**: Needs a value and comparison operator (e.g., `value:1000, operator:"<="` for max 1000).
- **Rule 4**: Needs minimum and maximum values (e.g., `{min:0, max:99, operator1: ">", operator2: "<="}` for value range).

### Step 4: Ensemble Table

The final ensemble table consolidates the CDE_ID, source table, field name, parameters, rule ID, dimension, original description, and standard description for seamless reference. Below is an example based on the given data, structured to integrate each rule and parameter.

| CDE_ID | Source_ID | CDE              | Reference                                      | Rule ID | Dimension    | Description                                                  | Standard Description                                         |

| 3      | Table_B   | Tenure           | {min:0, max:100, operator1:"≥", operator2:"≤"} | 4       | Validity     | The value should be at least zero and no more than 99        | FIELD VALUE MUST BE GREATER OR EQUAL THAN 0 AND LOWER THAN 100 |

| 6      | Table_B   | Tenure           | {min:0}                                        | 6       | Validity     | Value should be a number [0-9], no strings nor symbols are allowed | FIELD MUST BE NUMERIC INTEGER                                |

| 8      | Table_A   | Customer_ID      | {seq_max:3}                                    | 6       | Validity     | No more than 3 consecutive numbers allowed                   | FIELD NOT CONTAIN SEQUENCES OF MORE THAN 3 NUMBERS           |
